<h2>Beyond the developer</h2>
<p>My hats include tattered Rose-Hulman and faded Chicago sports baseball caps, a lightly scratched biking helmet, and broken Xbox headsets.</p>

<p>I started out as an algorithms/back-end guy, and I've since come to realize that visualization and presentation are just as important as the raw results. So this is a venture in learning by doing, and it brings back the excitement I had when I first started programming. </p>
<p>But this isn't just an exercise. My experiences are cluttered across photos on my phone, notes on my laptop, old Facebook posts, and memories that will eventually fade. That's just not scalable, so my goal is to centralize my thoughts and experiences here.</p>

<p>A lot of people list a long string of titles to describe themselves, but I'll talk about some experiences and leave labels up to you. But let's leave the professional details out, those are listed on my resume <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/peterseo">here</a>, along with my contact information.</p>
<p>A typical start in computing, I took a programming class in C++ during my last year of high school and found the perfect match between problem solving and math. Before that, I was actually planning on testing the waters in mechnical engineering! Since then, I constantly learn new ways to weave computing into everyday life.</p>
<p>For several years, I've been an avid SCUBA diver but the new experiences in programming have given a new lens to look through. My diving experiences have been mostly through a marine biology program that my high school conducted in the summers where we would log populations and contribute to the <a href="http://www.reef.org/">REEF database.</a> With my newfound computing skills, those experiences now provide much more insight!</p>
<p>As a Chicagolander, I actively follow the Bears, Blackhawks, and Cubs. Don't get me wrong, I root for the Bulls too but never quite took to basketball (although I was the backup guard on my 7th grade B-team). When I went to the Joint Math Meetings, I didn't think sports would be a focus but there are a lot of impressive, useful analyses being published! While I haven't ventured on my own in this area, I enjoy the new perspectives that it gives.</p>
<p>Within these interests, I weave data and programming to make a different lens to see through. The incredible computing community enables so many to do the same, and I hope that these posts start to give back to those that have given so much.</p></div>

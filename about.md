<h2>Beyond the developer</h2>
<p>My hats include tattered Rose-Hulman and faded Chicago sports baseball caps, a lightly scratched biking helmet, and broken Xbox headsets.</p>

<br>
<div><p>I started out as an algorithms/back-end guy, and I've since come to realize that visualization and presentation are just as important as the raw results. So this is a venture in learning by doing, and it brings back the excitement I had when I first started programming. </p><p>But this isn't just an exercise. My experiences are cluttered across photos on my phone, notes on my laptop, old Facebook posts, and memories that will eventually fade. That's just not scalable, so my goal is to centralize my thoughts and experiences here.</p></div>
<center><p ><strong><span class="manual">Who's writing these posts?</span></strong></p></center>
<div><p>A lot of people list a long string of titles to describe themselves, but I'll talk about some experiences and leave labels up to you. But let's leave the professional details out, those are listed on my resume <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/peterseo">here</a>, along with my contact information.</p><p>Two years ago (2014 as of this post), I was SCUBA diving in Bonaire through my high school's summer marine biology program. Making two or three dives a day for one week, we learned about the local ecosystem and logged species' populations. Many people don't know about the vast tolls that reefs and the fish populations have suffered recently, and I'm passionate about reversing this trend.</p><p>I've been incredibly lucky and granted opportunities over the past year to travel to Hawaii, London, and, most recently, Silicon Valley. While they've all been for business, I've made sure to go out and see the sights, eat the food, and meet the people!</p><p>Within these interests, I weave data and computing to make a different lens to see through. The incredible computing community enables so many to do the same, and I hope that these posts start to give back to those that have given so much.</p></div>

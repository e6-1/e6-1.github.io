<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>To provide further documentation and discussion around my public projects.</p>

<p>I'm currently an undergraduate at Rose-Hulman, studying computer science and mathematics. My experiences are cluttered across photos on my phone, notes on my laptop, old Facebook posts, and memories that will eventually fade. That's just not scalable, so my goal is to centralize my thoughts and experiences here. Outside of school and work, I enjoy exploring new trails on my bike, SCUBA diving, and following my hometown sports teams.</p>

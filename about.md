<p>My hats include tattered Rose-Hulman and faded Chicago sports baseball caps, a lightly scratched biking helmet, and broken Xbox headsets.</p>

<div><p>I started out as an algorithms/back-end guy, and I've since come to realize that visualization and presentation are just as important as the raw results. So this is a venture in learning by doing, and it brings back the excitement I had when I first started programming. </p><p>But this isn't just an exercise. My experiences are cluttered across photos on my phone, notes on my laptop, old Facebook posts, and memories that will eventually fade. That's just not scalable, so my goal is to centralize my thoughts and experiences here.</p></div>

One of the greatest research pursuits is the understanding of how our brains work. Towards this goal, a landmark discovery by Dr. John O'Keefe
 revealed that information flowing into the brain is not processed independently, but understood by relationships between the stimuli. He observed
 that hippocampal neurons fired based on where the organism was in its environment. Dr. O'Keefe termed these neurons as _place cells_, and the location
 causing their firing as a _place field_. Similar phenomenons have been observed with other sensory inputs, forming the more general idea of a _receptive field_.
 A neuron's receptive field is the subset of the stimulus space that causes the neuron to fire. In Dr. O'Keefe's studies, the stimulus space would be the visual
 and physical characteristics of a maze and an example receptive field could be a specific corner. But these results beg the question:

In the summer of 2015, I participated in the Pacific Undergraduate Research Experience led by Dr. Luis Garcia-Puente and Dr. Rebecca Garcia.
Studying computational algebraic geometry, the program began with two weeks of focused study and ended with three weeks of group research on an
applied problem. Myself, Ryan Kruse, Dane Miyata, and Ihmar Aldana were tasked with implementing an algorithm outlined in [The Neural Ring](http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4201) by
Dr. Carina Curto, Dr. Vladimir Itskov, Dr. Alan Veliz-Cuba, and Dr. Nora Youngs.

In the _personal_ tab, there's a brief post on receptive fields that contains a brief background and motivation for this project. The question we're
trying to answer is:

## What properties of a stimulus space can be extracted from neural activity?
